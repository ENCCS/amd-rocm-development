This training material is created by AMD in collaboration with ENCCS.
It covers how to develop and port
applications to run on AMD GPU and CPU hardware on top AMD-powered
supercomputers. You will learn about the ROCm software
development languages, libraries, and tools, as well as getting a
developer’s view of the hardware that powers the system. The material
focuses mostly on how to program applications to run on the GPU.



.. prereq::

   It is useful to have prior experience developing HPC applications,
   and some understanding of recent HPC computer hardware and the
   Linux operating system.
