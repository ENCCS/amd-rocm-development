## AMD GPU Accelerated Applications Catalog

Full list of AMD GPU Accelerated Application listed in the 
[GPU accelerated applications catalog](https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/gpu-accelerated-applications-catalog.pdf)

The list includes a lot of tools and libraries that can be useful to application developers. 
Here is the list of them from the catalog.

Note that the level of support for AMD and by AMD varies a lot across the list.

## Reporting issues

**Recommendation for best tracking of issues**:
- Report to your primary site 
    - LUMI
    - KTH

**Research projects (omnitrace, omniperf) are tracking github issues.**

**Siemens compiler is still in development:**
- Issues should be reported to AMD team and they will pass it on to Siemens
- Once the code gets upstreamed, it will be the regular GCC issues path

**Can report to AMD staff for help on proper reporting path.**
